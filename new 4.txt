You have been asked to install Azure Firewall. This will help your organization control inbound and 
outbound network access which is an important part of an overall network security plan. Specifically, 
you would like to create and test the following infrastructure components:

A virtual network with a workload subnet and a jump host subnet.
A virtual machine is each subnet.
A custom route that ensures all outbound workload traffic from the workload subnet must use the firewall.
