Good morning team,

I am not able to monitor calls through Amazon services, every time I tried to monitor a call I keep getting this message ''Failed to monitor agent.''. I already tried logging in and out of salesforce and amazon, 
restarted my computer and switched servers (from Microsoft to Chrome) and I still have the same issue. Could you please assist? Thanks!
