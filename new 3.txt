I’m filling out some missing info on a Business Continuity Plan document that Corp IT put together.  
For the External Inbound Communications during a Disaster, I need the phone numbers for each region.  Does not need to be a 800 number.
For the Internal Communication Methods during a disaster, I need the phone numbers for each region.
Departmental Business Continuity Plans, I need the location where plans are stored at.
For Appendix A, I need two phone numbers for each CorpIT rep, for each region.
For Appendix B. Supplier/Vendor Contracts and Contacts, I need the info for the table.

There’s other info needed, but these five are the first ones that stand out.

External Inbound Communications during a Disaster

Lines routed to a message if phones go down: 
● 800- (Main Line) 
● 800- (Acct Relations) 
● 800- (Billing Inquiries) 
● 800- (NA Support) 
● 800- (MX Support) 
● 800- (UK Support) 
● 800- (ANZ Support) 

Note: The Fax Line (800-XXX-XXXX) will be routed to a Nextiva fax-to-email line if phone switch or Xmedius go down.


Internal Communication Methods during a disaster 
Employees may receive notification of an emergency via email, face-to-face, global voice message, or communications on the disaster Message Board. Voice messages are expected to be in place to announce building closures or late openings. 
If phone lines are down, below are the alternative contact numbers to be used for Disaster Communications in addition to any electronic communication channel.

Alternative 	US 	UK 	AU 	NZ 	MX 
toll-free Voice Mail line 	 	 	 	 	 
IT Support 	 	 	 	 	 
Help Desk 	 	 	 	 	 

internal lines will be automatically routed to a back-up line that provides recorded message capability. Employees will be directed toward the online Message Board during disasters for the latest communications.  
General emergency message for IT Support, Help Desk internal lines: 
A global phone message has been activated for TeletracNavman Any regional employees as a response to an emergency. Please log onto DR.TeletracNavman.COM for further instructions and updated information. 


Departmental Business Continuity Plans

Each TeletracNavman business unit will develop and maintain a business continuity plan for their respective areas of responsibility to ensure their processes are addressed. However, initially, the focus is on customer-facing groups. Plans should be reviewed with employees on a quarterly basis as well as incorporated into new hire orientation. All business continuity documentation will be stored at S:\SOME SHARED DRIVE/LOCATION. 

Appendix A – Key Contact Information

This appendix provides all the necessary Teletrac Navman business and technical contact information, by region, for people that will have a role and responsibility during Disaster Recovery and Restoration.  

Appendix B. Supplier/Vendor Contracts and Contacts 

Overview 
In this section Teletrac maintains a list of its critical vendors and supplier's contracts and contacts to facilitate equipment replacement as part of its recovery and failback solutions. 

Vendor 	Primary Name 	Primary phone 	Secondary phone 	Contract #

Amazon AWS 	 	 	 	 
Dell
